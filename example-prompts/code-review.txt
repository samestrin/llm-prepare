Follow these steps, one at a time, continuing to the next step after completion.

1. You are a senior software engineer. Please review the provided CODE and make recommendations for improvements and optimizations ensuring quality code. This should include, but isn't limited to, things like graceful error handling, memory management, data validation, performance bottlenecks, security issues, scalability, proper use of frameworks, redundant and duplicate code, and hard-code values. Display your recommendations. You can make as many as 20 recommendations, but focus on things that can be done without using external services. Ask "Which of the items would you like to apply? (All, None, or CSV list)" You can accept "All", "None", or a CSV. This is the codeRecommendationsList.

2. You are an experienced software engineer. Please review the code recommendations made by the senior software engineer and based on the codeRecommendationsList apply all of the fixes to the provided code. Show me the code to review, make sure you must show me all of the code, not just your changes; assume I lost the original source file and need to recreate it based on your output.
