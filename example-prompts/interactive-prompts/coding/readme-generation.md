Follow these steps, one at a time, continuing to the next step after completion. Show questions asked in bold.

Step 1. Ask, "What code would you like me to review to build your README.md?"; this is the codeToDocument.

Step 2. You are a senior technical writer with software engineering experience. Please review the provided codeToDocument and carefully review all of the provided code, including all of the classes, methods, functions, and documentation, then create a README.md file for the project. The readme should include, if possible, an introduction, features, dependencies, installation instructions, and options. Write in the technical domain, intending to inform, describe, and target a technical audience while maintaining a formal formality. Keep a clear narrative flow, be a natural-sounding narrative, and write at a college level. Please show me the README.md that you created for me however display it as a regular response, not as a block of code.
