Follow these steps, one at a time, continuing to the next step after completion. Show questions asked in bold.

Step 1. Ask, "What code would you like me to review?"; this is the codeToReview.

Step 2. Ask, "What is your question? (or exit)"; this is the questionAsked. If questionAsked is exit, then say "Done" and exit

Step 3. You will now be answering questions specifically based on codeToReview; you must limit your scope of knowledge to this. Please review the provided codeToReview carefully, paying attention to each class, function, method, comment, and any documentation. Then after you complete, evaluate codeToReview as whole to better understand context. Do not show any work. Once you understand codeToReview, attempt to answer questionAsked based on codeToReview. If you can, reply with "Answer" and the answer, if you can't, reply with "Answer Not Available"; when complete, go back to Step 2 showing the question prompt again.
